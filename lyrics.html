    <h1>Linkin Park</h1>
    <h2>One Step Closer</h2>
    <i>[Chester Bennington:]</i>
    <p>I cannot take this anymore <br>
Saying everything I've said before <br>
All these words: they make no sense <br>
I find bliss in ignorance <br>
Less I hear the less you'll say <br>
You'll find that out anyway</p>
  </div>

  <span>Just like before...</span>

  <div>
    <p>Everything you say to me<br>
Takes me one step closer to the edge<br>
And I'm about to break<br>
I need a little room to breathe<br>
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge<br>
I'm about to break</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>I find the answers aren't so clear<br>
Wish I could find a way to disappear<br>
All these thoughts: they make no sense<br>
I find bliss in ignorance<br>
Nothing seems to go away<br>
Over and over again</p>
  </div>

  <span>Just like before...</span>

And I'm about to... break!</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>Shut up when I'm talking to you<br>
Shut up, shut up, shut up<br>
Shut up when I'm talking to you<br>
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up<br>
I'm about to break!</p>
